## How to re-pull data for a selected data services

Within a Data Orchestration template, you have the ability to select if you’d like to re-pull data for the selected data service if the existing data for that data service is older than X amount of hours/days/months. 

This feature will allow you to have flexibility with refreshing/re-pulling data for data servicesю

To set this condition, simply select a data block for the data service you’d like to automatically re-pull the data for→ check “Re-pull the data if it’s older than” checkbox and type the number of hours/days/months you’d like to apply to this condition. 

**Example:** You have set the condition to re-pull data for Plaid if the data you have is older than 10 days. That means that if the data you originally pulled for this deal/business is older than 10 days, if you run the Data orchestration template → instead of using the data you have, it will automatically rerun the Plaid service and pull fresh data. 
However, if the data you originally pulled is not older than 10 days, then if you rerun the Data Orchestration template → Plaid service will not be refreshed, and DO template will use the Plaid data you previously pulled.
