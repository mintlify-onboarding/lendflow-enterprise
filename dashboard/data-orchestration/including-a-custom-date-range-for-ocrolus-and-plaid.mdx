## Amount of prior months, custom selection and month-to-date

The custom date range can be included only for 2 data service providers - Ocrolus and Plaid. 

You have 3 options for the custom date range:

* Include the amount of prior months you would like to use for the attribute 

* Select custom month range

* Select month-to-date

The three options mentioned above cannot be selected together. They all have to be selected separately from each other. 

If you select the number of prior months option - the value of the attribute you have selected within the condition you have set will be evaluated based on the number of prior months you have selected. It is dynamic because it depends on the most recent months. In this example, it relies on the last six months.

If you select the custom selection option - the value of the attribute you have selected within the condition you have set will be evaluated based on the months you have selected. It is static as it relies on the months you have selected.

If you select months to date option - the value of the attribute you have selected within the condition you have set will be evaluated based on month to date time range (from the beginning of the current months till today’s date). This option is dynamic as it changes based on the date you are running orchestration. 

If you select “Apply to All” button - the time range you have selected for the current attribute will be applied to all attributes within the group.
