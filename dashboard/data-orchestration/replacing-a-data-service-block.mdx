## How to replace a data block in Data orchestration
For each data service a user drags into their orchestration tree, a user may decide afterwards that they want to replace a data orchestration block in the tree. 

### Replace Icon Method
Click on the desired block the user would like to replace and select the ‘Replace’ option. A popup window will appear where the user can search or directly select the new data provider. Once selected, a message will appear asking the user to confirm their choice. Note all existing conditional arguments will be deleted once the user confirms their choice by hitting ‘Replace’.
