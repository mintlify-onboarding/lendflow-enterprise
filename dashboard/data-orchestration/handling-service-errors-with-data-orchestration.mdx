## How to use the "Has Unexpected Error" attribute

This feature helps users build out orchestration templates that use an attribute, which can help account for errors in the orchestration. This attribute is called “Has Unexpected Error.” If there is an error in the orchestration, the template would not automatically fail if the user uses this attribute. This is an error recognition tool to help users account for edge cases where a service may not run properly. Instead of failing the orchestration, the user can plan ahead for this. The user can select this attribute that can force the system to allow them to pass, fail, or review depending on the response. 

* In the example below: when the user selects this attribute and believes there may be an unexpected error, they can use the boolean value of “true.” The user has chosen “fail” as the conditional argument when an error exists.

* In the example below: when the user selects this attribute and believes there may not be an unexpected error, they can use the boolean value of “false.” The user has chosen “pass” as the conditional argument when no error exists. 

<Info>
  Boolean values have true and false as options.

<Note>
  **Potential reasons for service errors can include but are not limited to:**

  - There may have been bad code that has caused a PHP error at run time that we do not have tests for.

  - When using Experian, a request for Experian bankruptcies may end in an error because Experian is down.

  - When using Ocrolus, when the Lendflow system receives data back from Ocrolus, it can be incomplete for an unknown reason. In this case, the analysis of the data in an orchestration fails unexpectedly.
