## How to set an “Automatic” or “Manually” triggered Orchestration

Within an orchestration template, a user can select a “Manual” or “Automatic” orchestration. Users can only select one option. This can only be changed when the template is a draft

<Info>
  **Manual Vs Automatic**

  Manual Orchestrations require that users must start orchestration within a deal at the stage with data enrichment logic (for a traditional marketplace workflow, this is the “underwriting” stage). \n\nAutomatic Orchestrations are triggered automatically when a deal enters the workflow stage that has the data enrichment logic (for a traditional marketplace workflow, this is the “underwriting” stage)

## How to use a manually triggered orchestration

To use a manually triggered orchestration, users must go into the deal in which you want to use the orchestration. Users can click the “Run Orchestration” dropdown and select the orchestration you have created.

<Info>
  Users can only select one orchestration at a time. 
  
  Only published orchestrations are available for selection in the dropdown. When a user clicks on the dropdown orchestration template, the services will run accordingly.

## How to find the trigger on the orchestration template percentage

There is a “Trigger” column that can help users identify whether a template is manually or automatically triggered.
