This section provides instructions on how to access the Data Orchestration feature within Lendflow. You must navigate to “Profile” (bottom left corner) and click on the “Orchestration” tab as seen here. On this page, you can see the orchestration template name, orchestration IDs, descriptions, workflows, and the time that it was last updated.

<Tip>
- Template names help you customize what you call an orchestration.

- Orchestration IDs are unique identifiers that consist of letters and numbers.

- Descriptions can provide context on your orchestration.

- There are multiple types of workflows. Workflows are important because they help you understand how deals can be processed, as well as the specific data points that are relevant. A few example workflows include marketplace, internal funding, data collection, and more.

- The time it was updated can help you keep track of when an orchestration is changed.
