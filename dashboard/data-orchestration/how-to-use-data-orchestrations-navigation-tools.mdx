**How to use the hand tool**
To move around/navigate within the data orchestration template - you can use the hand tool in the top left corner. This tool will allow you to move to different parts of the screen/template by holding the cursor and moving to a desired part of the screen.

**How to use the arrow tool**
If you select the arrow tool below it, you won’t be able to move to different parts of the screen/template by holding a cursor. You still have the ability to click on the data providers blocks and conditions and perform other actions.
