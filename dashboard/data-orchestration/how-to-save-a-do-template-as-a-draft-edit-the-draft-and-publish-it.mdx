## How to save Data Orchestration template as a Draft

To save a Data Orchestration template as a draft, you must select the “Save as Draft” button during the template creation/editing process. There is no functionality to version the template right now, so the last version always overwrites the previous version. Please see the video below.

## How to publish Data Orchestration template

To publish a Data Orchestration template, you must select the “Publish” button in the top right corner during the template creation/editing process.  It can be published once. Published templates cannot be saved as drafts, edited, or published again. When a template is published, a tooltip appears: “Your draft is being published. You no longer will have access to the draft.”
