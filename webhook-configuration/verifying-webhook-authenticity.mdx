Webhook verification is optional, but recommended.

## Verifying a Signature

Signature verification is done within your application's code by attempting to recreate and match the signature sent in the `Lendflow-Verification-Signature` header. The process in pseudocode is as follows:

```bash bash 
base64encode(hmac('sha256', timestamp + body, webhook_secret))
```

If signature verification fails, the webhook request should be rejected.

<Note>
    **The Webhook Secret**

    Verification signatures are signed by your organization's webhook secret; a token that should be viewed and treated like a password.

    Your organization's webhook secret must be requested from Lendflow's customer success team.
</Note>

**An Example**

The example below shows how to verify a signature with PHP.

```php webhook.php
<?php

$signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_Lendflow_Verification_Signature'];
$timestamp = $_SERVER['HTTP_Lendflow_Verification_Timestamp'];
$body = file_get_contents('php://input');
$secret = 'your-webhook-secret-here';

$verification = base64_encode(
    hash_hmac('sha256', $timestamp . $body, $secret, binary: true),
);
    
    
if ($signature !== $verification) {
    http_response_code(400);
    exit;
}

// process the verified webhook request here...
```
