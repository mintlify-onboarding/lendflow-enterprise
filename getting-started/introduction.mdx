## Welcome To the Lendflow API

Welcome to the Lendflow API! This document describes how clients can integrate with Lendflow, to create and monitor capital solutions offered by Lendflow.

We currently have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right. If you would like to request any additional bindings, then please contact the Technology Team at tech@lendflow.io and we will aim to add them in the near future.
