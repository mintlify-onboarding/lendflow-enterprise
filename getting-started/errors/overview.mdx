Lendflow uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

| Status code | Description                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `20x`         | The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted  |
| `4xx`         | The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled           |
| `50x`         | The Lendflow server failed to fulfill a request (these are rare) |

When the error occurs, the Lendflow API response consists:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| message   | `string` | Always present. High-level summary of an error (ie "Unauthenticated", "The HTTP method associated with the request is not supported. Supported methods: GET, HEAD, POST")                                      |
| errors    | `object` | Present when the error comes from the request validation. An object whose keys are fields with errors, and values are arrays of the error messages found (ie. "The selected requested_products.0 is invalid.") |
