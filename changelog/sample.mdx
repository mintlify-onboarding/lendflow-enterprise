        **We’ve added Portuguese (Brazilian) translations!**

        Building upon our existing language support (based on your customers’ browser locale), which already included French, German, and Spanish translations, we’ve expanded our capabilities to cater to an even broader audience.

        Need another language? Let us know and we’ll prioritize getting it added.

        **Enhanced Document Customization with Markdown & HTML Support**

        Until now, you could only utilize Markdown for your Documents. However, we're excited to inform you that HTML support has been seamlessly integrated, offering you even more versatility to tailor your Documents exactly to your liking.

        We've revamped the way partial replaces work, enhancing your data editing experience for maximum smoothness and intuitiveness. In the past, when you attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what you had in mind.

        For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously turning null.

        We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements without the hassle of unexpected null values.

        We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but now, we're considering both the option labels and values, making sure nothing is left behind. This means you'll have a smoother and more reliable experience when mapping your data, ensuring that everything is captured correctly.

        **Localization is Now Available**

        ![image](/images/2b116d9-golddb2.png)


        We are excited to introduce localization features in Flatfile! Now, your customers will enjoy automatic translations based on their browser locale, including French, German, and Spanish.

        Key Features:

        - Translations are exclusively applied in Spaces (guest areas).
        - Our user-friendly guide will assist you in effortlessly translating and personalizing the content within your space, whether it's custom actions, documents, and more.
        - Require another language? Send us a note, and we'll make it a priority to include it.

        [Follow the guide](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/localization) or try the [Localization demo Space](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started) to get started.

        **New: Promote Sheet Actions**

        ![image](/images/2b116d9-golddb2.png)

       Previously, the `primary:true` concept on Actions didn't affect Sheet actions, leaving them all in the "more actions" drop-down. But now, setting primary to true will showcase these actions right in the Sheet toolbar, as buttons with clear, user-friendly text.

        You can now effortlessly view up to 500k records at once. When you reach the end of the table, a helpful message will appear, reminding you that there's more data waiting. Simply search or filter to reduce the size of your dataset and access it all. This change was added due to browser limitations that restrict maximum height in the DOM.

    Previously, guests without access to the specific workbook would encounter a "Workbook Not Found" error. Now, a fallback mechanism has been implemented to validate access to the `primaryWorkbook`, ensuring a smoother experience for users.

       Resolved an issue where the import button could prematurely appear before a file was ready to be imported. This was due to an early update of the file's status with a workbook ID, which has now been adjusted to wait until the data is queriable before updating. The import process now aligns better with the file's readiness.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

      **`acknowledge: false`**

      ![image](/images/2b116d9-golddb2.png)

      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.

      **`acknowledge: true`**

      ![image](/images/2b116d9-golddb2.png)

      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message:
            "Text here.",
        },
      });
      ```

      This enhancement provides flexibility in how you choose to inform users about job outcomes. [Learn more](http://flatfile.com/docs/guides/actions#usage).

      }}
    >
        **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, Flatfile resources, or trigger downloads upon job completion.

      **Usage**
        <CodeGroup>
        ```jsx listener
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: IdNext | WaitNext | UrlNext | DownloadNext,
            message:
              "Text here.",
          },
        });
        ```
        ```jsx Types
        type IdNext = {
          type: 'id' //link to a Flatfile resource
          id: string
        }

        type WaitNext = {
          type: 'wait' //only used in embedded Flatfile
        }

        type UrlNext = {
          type: 'url' //display a link to an external url
          url: string
          label: string
        }

        type DownloadNext = {
          type: 'download' // display and trigger a download
          url: string
          fileName: string
          label: string
        }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

        ![image](../changelog/images/disabled_actions.png)

       Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

        **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional `requireAllValid` flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

        **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `requireSelection` flag. When set to `true`, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.
