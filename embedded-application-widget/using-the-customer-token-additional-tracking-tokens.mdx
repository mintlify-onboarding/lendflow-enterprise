Step 3: When you add the integration script to your website, you can incorporate a customer token (client uuid) into the script as well as any array of additional tracking tokens. These tokens will be passed through with applications that are completed through this integration script. To embed, follow the integration steps in the "Embedding Application Widget" guide.

Step 4: View the client uuid & customer tracking tokens within a deal. Click "Deals" Tab > Click an individual Deal > Click "Tracking"
Here, you can view the Client UUID and additional tracking tokens that were submitted with the application. You can also add additional tracking tokens directly from the dashboard.

Step 5 (Optional): The tokens can also be used within a specific widget link, by modifying the widget link and appending: `&customerToken=123` and `&application_tracking_token=aa:`

Thus, instead of `https://iw.lendflow.com/?env=BKckmXzcXUvTsfVx7nlD5yNsxRGYGUSX`

the widget link with tracking tokens would be: `https://iw.lendflow.com/?env=BKckmXzcXUvTsfVx7nlD5yNsxRGYGUSX&customerToken=123&application_tracking_token=aa&application_tracking_token=bb`

In this case, any applications generated from the below link would have the specified tracking tokens attached.
